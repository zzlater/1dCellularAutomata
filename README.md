# 1D Cellular Automata

## What is a Cellular Automaton?
A **Cellular Automaton (CA)** is a discrete model studied in computational theory, mathematics, and complexity science. In simple terms, it consists of an array of cells that evolve over discrete time steps based on predefined rules. Each cell's next state depends on its current value and the values of its immediate neighbors.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **1D Cellular Automaton** based on an initial array of `1s` and `0s`. The evolution of the system is dictated by a **rule set**‚Äîa binary representation that determines how each new cell is generated.

At each step (or **generation**), the automaton applies the rule set to each cell, considering its left and right neighbors. This process continues iteratively, generating new arrays that form interesting patterns over time.

## Usage

 - **Compile the Program**  
   Run the following command inside the project folder:  
   ```
   make
   ```
   to generate the executable.
 - **Run the Program**  
   After compiling, run the program with:  
   ```
   ./CA
   ```
   You will then be prompted to enter a rule set integer between 0-255
 - **Run a Test Example**
	Execute a test run using rule set *69*
	```
	make Test
	``` 
 - **Clean up Compiled Files**
	To remove binary/object files:
	```
	make Clean
	```
## Interesting Inputs
 - 58 (House shapedüè†)
 - 69 (Double triangle on top of square)
 - 126 (Fractal-like structure) My favorite :)
